espic1d is a 1-D electrostatic PIC code, for non-relativistic electrons mobile along the x-axis,
the ions are stationary. The electric field is along the x-axis, and a constant magnetic field
is present along the z-axis.

It uses CGS units everywhere.

Compile:
gcc espic1d.c -lm -o espic1d

Run:
$> ./espic1d

display.c is a code for the display of data created by espic1d.
It uses Gnuplot for creating the graphs. This should be accessible from the path.
